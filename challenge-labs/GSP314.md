## Challenge scenario

You have started a new role as a Cloud Architect for Jooli Inc. You are expected to help design and manage the infrastructure at Jooli. Common tasks revolve around designing environments for the various projects within the Jooli Inc. family but also include provisioning resources for projects.

You are expected to have the skills and knowledge for these tasks, so don't expect step-by-step guides.

You have been asked to assist the kraken team complete setting up their product development environment. The previous Cloud Architect working with the kraken team was unfortunately too curious about if krakens were real or not, and has gone missing after venturing out into the open sea last weekend in search of such a beast.

Jooli Inc. management has supreme faith in your abilities, don't let them down! (Seriously, they don't need the dates to slip further).

The kraken team is building a next generation tool and they will host the application on Kubernetes. The project source code is stored in Cloud Source Repositories, with Spinnaker building and deploying any changes into the build Kubernetes environment.

Some Jooli Inc. standards you should follow:

- Create all resources in the `us-east1` region and `us-east1-b` zone, unless otherwise directed.
- Use the project VPCs.
- Naming is normally team-resource, e.g. an instance could be named **kraken-webserver1**.
- Allocate cost effective resource sizes. Projects are monitored and excessive resource use will result in the containing project's termination (and possibly yours), so beware. This is the guidance the monitoring team is willing to share; unless directed, `use n1-standard-1`.


## Task 1: Create the production environment

![](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/KQtWhw5izJUfg3%2BL%2B0uLZQ6v44HXVd9BOdAOhhatO3Q%3D)

1. Create the **kraken-prod-vpc**.

    - In the **Cloud Console**, click the **Navigation menu** > **Compute Engine** > **VM Instances**.
    - Click on the SSH button next to **kraken-jumphost** instance.
    - Run the following command:

        ```
        cd /work/dm

        sed -i s/SET_REGION/us-east1/g prod-network.yaml

        gcloud deployment-manager deployments create prod-network \
            --config=prod-network.yaml
        ```

2. Create a **Kubernetes cluster** callled `CLUSTER_NAME` in the new network.

    ```
    gcloud config set compute/zone us-east1-b

    gcloud container clusters create [CLUSTER_NAME] \
        --num-nodes 2 \
        --network kraken-prod-vpc \
        --subnetwork kraken-prod-subnet

    gcloud container clusters get-credentials [CLUSTER_NAME] 
    ```

3. Create the frontend and backend deployments and services.

    ```
    cd /work/k8s

    for F in $(ls *.yaml); do kubectl create -f $F; done

    kubectl get services
    ```


## Task 2: Setup the Admin instance

1. Create **VM instance** called `INSTANCE_NAME`, a network interface in **kraken-mgmt-subnet** and another in **kraken-prod-subnet**.

    ```
    gcloud config set compute/zone us-east1-b
    
    gcloud compute instances create [INSTANCE_NAME] \
        --network-interface="subnet=kraken-mgmt-subnet" \
        --network-interface="subnet=kraken-prod-subnet"
    ```

2. In the **Cloud Console**, click the **Navigation menu** > **Monitoring**.
3. When the **Monitoring Overview** page opens, your metrics scope project is ready.
4. In the left menu, click **Alerting**, and then click **Create Policy**.
5. Click **Add condition**.
6. Set the following values, leave all other values at their defaults:

    | Property | Value (type value or select option as specified) |
    | --- | --- |
    | Resource type | VM Instance |
    | Metric | CPU utilization |
    | Filter | instance_name = `INSTANCE_NAME` |
    | Condition | is above |
    | Threshold | `THRESHOLD` |
    | For | 1 minute |

7. Click **Add**
8. Click **Next**.
8. Click on drop down arrow next to **Notification Channels**, then click on **Manage Notification Channels**. 
9. A **Notification channels** page will open in new tab. Scroll down the page and click on **Add new** for **Email**.
10. In **Create Email Channel** dialog box, enter your personal email address in the **Email Address** field and a **Display name**.
11. Click **Save**.
12. Go back to the previous **Create alerting policy** tab.
13. Click on **Notification Channels** again, then click on the **Refresh icon** to get the display name you mentioned in the previous step.
14. Now, select your **Display name** and click **Ok**.
15. Click **Next**.
16. Mention the **Alert name** as `INSTANCE_NAME`.
17. Click **Save**.


## Task 3: Verify the Spinnaker deployment

1. Open a new session in **Cloud Shell** and run the following command:

    ```
    gcloud config set compute/zone us-east1-b
    
    gcloud container clusters get-credentials spinnaker-tutorial
    
    DECK_POD=$(kubectl get pods --namespace default -l "cluster=spin-deck" \
        -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
    
    kubectl port-forward --namespace default $DECK_POD 8080:9000 >> /dev/null &
    ```

2. To get to the **Spinnaker** user interface, click on the **Web Preview** button in **Cloud Shell**, then click **Preview on port 8080**.
3. Click **Applications** at the top of the screen to see your list of managed applications.
4. Click **sample** to view your application deployment.
5. Click **Pipelines** at the top to view your applications pipeline status.
6. Click **Start Manual Execution** and then click **Run** to trigger the pipeline this first time.
7. Click **Execution Details** to see more information about the pipeline's progress.
8. Click a stage to see details about it.
9. Hover over the orange person icon and click **Continue**.
10. Back to **Cloud Shell** and run the following command to push a change:

    ```
    gcloud config set compute/zone us-east1-b
    
    gcloud source repos clone sample-app
    
    cd sample-app
    
    touch a
    
    git config --global user.email "$(gcloud config get-value account)"
    
    git config --global user.name "Student"
    
    git commit -a -m "change"
    
    git tag v1.0.1
    
    git push --tags
    ```

11. Go back to the **Spinnaker** user interface.
12. Hover over the orange person icon and click **Continue**.

## Congratulations!
