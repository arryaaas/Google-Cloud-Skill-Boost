## Challenge scenario

You have just completed training on containers and their creation and management and now you need to demonstrate to the Jooli Inc. development team your new skills. You have to help with some of their initial work on a new project around an application environment utilizing Kubernetes. Some of the work was already done for you, but other parts require your expert skills.

You are expected to create container images, store the images in a repository, and configure a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline to automate the build for the product. Your know that Kurt, your supervisor, will ask you to complete these tasks:

- Create a Docker image and store the Dockerfile.
- Test the created Docker image.
- Push the Docker image into the Container Repository.
- Use the image to create and expose a deployment in Kubernetes.
- Update the image and push a change to the deployment.
- Create a pipeline in Jenkins to deploy a new version of your image when the source code changes.

Some Jooli Inc. standards you should follow:

- Create all resources in the `us-east1` region and `us-east1-b` zone, unless otherwise directed.
- Use the project VPCs.
- Naming is normally team-resource, e.g. an instance could be named **kraken-webserver1**.
- Allocate cost effective resource sizes. Projects are monitored and excessive resource use will result in the containing project's termination (and possibly yours), so beware. This is the guidance the monitoring team is willing to share: unless directed, use `n1-standard-1`.


## Your challenge

As soon as you sit down at your desk and open your new laptop you receive the following request to complete these tasks. Good luck!


## Task 1: Create a Docker image and store the Dockerfile

Open Cloud Shell and install marking scripts to help check your progress.

```
source <(gsutil cat gs://cloud-training/gsp318/marking/setup_marking_v2.sh)
```

Use Cloud Shell to clone the `valkyrie-app` source code repository (it is in your project).

```
gcloud source repos clone valkyrie-app
```

Create `valkyrie-app/Dockerfile` and add the configuration below.

```
cd valkyrie-app

cat > Dockerfile <<EOF
FROM golang:1.10
WORKDIR /go/src/app
COPY source .
RUN go install -v
ENTRYPOINT ["app","-single=true","-port=8080"]
EOF
```

Use `valkyrie-app/Dockerfile` to create a Docker image called `IMAGE_NAME` with the tag `TAG_NAME`.

```
docker build -t [IMAGE_NAME]:[TAG_NAME] .
```

Once you have created the Docker image, and before clicking **Check my progress**, run `step1_v2.sh` to perform the local check of your work.

```
cd ..

./step1_v2.sh
```


## Task 2: Test the created Docker image

Launch a container using the image `IMAGE_WITH_TAG`. You need to map the hostâ€™s port 8080 to port 8080 on the container. Add `&` to the end of the command to cause the container to run in the background.

```
cd valkyrie-app

docker run -p 8080:8080 [IMAGE_WITH_TAG] &
```

Once you have your container running, and before clicking **Check my progress**, run `step2_v2.sh` to perform the local check of your work.

```
cd ..

./step2_v2.sh
```


## Task 3: Push the Docker image in the Container Repository

Push the Docker image `IMAGE_WITH_TAG` into the Container Registry. Make sure you re-tag the container to `gcr.io/GCP Project ID/IMAGE_WITH_TAG`.

```
cd valkyrie-app

docker tag [IMAGE_WITH_TAG] gcr.io/$GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT/[IMAGE_WITH_TAG]

docker push gcr.io/$GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT/[IMAGE_WITH_TAG]
```

## Task 4: Create and expose a deployment in Kubernetes

Replace `IMAGE_HERE` with `gcr.io/GCP Project ID/IMAGE_WITH_TAG` in `valkyrie-app/k8s/deployment.yaml`.

```
cd k8s

sed -i s#IMAGE_HERE#gcr.io/$GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT/[IMAGE_WITH_TAG]#g ./deployment.yaml

sed -i s#IMAGE_HERE#gcr.io/$GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT/[IMAGE_WITH_TAG]#g ./deployment.yaml
```

Get the Kubernetes credentials before you deploy the image onto the Kubernetes cluster.

```
gcloud container clusters get-credentials valkyrie-dev --zone us-east1-d
```

Create and expose a deployment in Kubernetes.

```
kubectl create -f ./deployment.yaml

kubectl create -f ./service.yaml
```

## Task 5: Update the deployment with a new version of valkyrie-app

Merge a branch called **kurt-dev** into **master**. 

```
git merge origin/kurt-dev
```

Before deploying the new code, increase the replicas from 1 to `REPLICAS_COUNT` to ensure you don't cause an outage.

```
kubectl edit deployment valkyrie-dev
```

Build the new code as version `UPDATED_VERSION` of valkyrie-app, push the updated image to the Container Repository, and then redeploy to the valkyrie-dev cluster.

```
cd ..

docker build -t gcr.io/$GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT/[IMAGE_NAME]:[UPDATED_VERSION] .

docker push gcr.io/$GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT/[IMAGE_NAME]:[UPDATED_VERSION]
```

Make sure you replaced image version from `v0.0.1` to `v0.0.2`.

```
kubectl edit deployment valkyrie-dev
```

## Task 6: Create a pipeline in Jenkins to deploy your app

Make sure you don't have a running container.

```
docker ps
```

If you do, kill it.

```
docker kill [CONTAINER_ID]
```

Connect to the Jenkins console using the commands below.

```
export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods --namespace default -l "app.kubernetes.io/component=jenkins-master" -l "app.kubernetes.io/instance=cd" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")

kubectl port-forward $POD_NAME 8080:8080 >> /dev/null &
```

Get the password using the commands below.

```
printf $(kubectl get secret cd-jenkins -o jsonpath="{.data.jenkins-admin-password}" | base64 --decode);echo
```

Connect to Jenkins:

- Copy the auto-generated password for Jenkins admin from output in **Cloud Shell**. 
- To get to the **Jenkins** user interface, click on the **Web Preview** button in **Cloud Shell**, then click **Preview on port 8080**. 
- Log in with username admin and your auto-generated password.

Adding your service account credentials:

- In the Jenkins user interface, click **Manage Jenkins** in the left navigation then click **Manage Credentials**. 
- Under **Stores scope to Jenkins** click **Jenkins**. 
- Click **Global credentials (unrestricted)**. 
- Click **Add Credentials** in the left navigation. 
- Select **Google Service Account from metadata** from the **Kind** drop-down and click **OK**.

Creating the Jenkins job:

- In the Jenkins dashboard, click **New Item** in the left navigation. 
- Name the project **valkyrie-dev**, then choose the **Pipeline** option and click **OK**. 
- On the next page, in the **Pipeline** section, select **Pipeline script from SCM** from the **Pipeline script** drop-down. 
- Select **Git** from the **SCM** drop-down.
- Back to Google Cloud Console and run this following command.

    ```
    gcloud source repos list
    ```

- Copy the URL from output in **Cloud Shell**. 
- Back to **Jenkins** user interface, set the **Repository URL** with your copied URL from output in **Cloud Shell**. 
- From the **Credentials** drop-down, select the name of the credentials you created when adding your service account in the previous steps.
- Make sure that **Branch specifier** is set to `*/master`.
- Click **Save**.

Edit `valkyrie-app/Jenkinsfile` and change `YOUR_PROJECT` to your actual project id.

```
sed -i "s/YOUR_PROJECT/$GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT/g" Jenkinsfile
```

Edit `valkyrie-app/source/html.go` and change the two occurrences of green to orange.

```
sed -i "s/green/orange/g" source/html.go
```

Use git to add all the changes then commit those changes to the master branch and push the changes back to the repository.

```
git config --global user.email "[EMAIL]" 

git config --global user.name "[USERNAME]"

git add .

git commit -m "built pipeline init"

git push 
```
