## Challenge scenario

Your company has decided to deploy new application services in the cloud and your assignment is developing a secure framework for managing the Windows services that will be deployed. You will need to create a new VPC network environment for the secure production Windows servers.

Production servers must initially be completely isolated from external networks and cannot be directly accessed from, or be able to connect directly to, the internet. In order to configure and manage your first server in this environment, you will also need to deploy a bastion host, or jump box, that can be accessed from the internet using the Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). The bastion host should only be accessible via RDP from the internet, and should only be able to communicate with the other compute instances inside the VPC network using RDP.

Your company also has a monitoring system running from the default VPC network, so all compute instances must have a second network interface with an internal only connection to the default VPC network.


## Your challenge

Deploy the secure Windows machine that is not configured for external communication inside a new VPC subnet, then deploy the Microsoft Internet Information Server on that secure machine.

1. A new non-default VPC has been created.

    - In the **Cloud Console**, click the **Navigation menu** > **VPC network** > **VPC networks**.
    - Click **Create VPC Network**.
    - Set the **Name** to `securenetwork`.
    - Dont click **Create** first, go to step 2.

2. The new VPC contains a new non-default subnet within it.

    - For **Subnet creation mode**, click **Custom**.
    - Set the following values, leave all other values at their defaults:

        | Property | Value (type value or select option as specified) |
        | --- | --- |
        | Name | `secure-subnet` |
        | Region | us-central1 |
        | IP address range | 192.168.16.0/20 |

    - Click **Create**.

3. A firewall rule exists that allows TCP port 3389 traffic ( for RDP ).

    - In the **Cloud Console**, click the **Navigation menu** > **VPC Network** > **Firewall**.
    - Click **Create firewall rule**.
    - Configure the following settings:
        
        | Property | Value (type value or select option as specified) |
        | --- | --- |
        | Name | secure-allow-rdp |
        | Network | `securenetwork` |
        | Direction | Ingress |
        | Targets | Specified target tags |
        | Target tags | `rdp` |
        | Source filter | IP ranges |
        | Source IP ranges | 0.0.0.0/0 |
        | Protocols and ports | Specified protocols and ports, and then *check* tcp, *type:* 3389 |
    
    - Click **Create**.

4. A Windows compute instance called `vm-bastionhost` exists that has a public ip-address to which the TCP port 3389 firewall rule applies.

    - In the **Cloud Console**, click the **Navigation menu** > **Compute Engine** > **VM Instances**.
    - Click **Create instance**.
    - Set the following values, leave all other values at their defaults:

        | Property | Value (type value or select option as specified) |
        | --- | --- |
        | Name | `vm-bastionhost` |
        | Region | us-central1 |
        | Zone | us-cental1-a |
        | Series | N1 |
        | Machine type | n1-standard-2 |

    - In the **Boot disk** section, click **Change** to begin configuring your boot disk.
    - Set the following values, leave all other values at their defaults:

        | Property | Value (type value or select option as specified) |
        | --- | --- |
        | Operating system | Windows Server |
        | Version | Windows Server 2016 Datacenter |
        | Size (GB) | 150 |

    - Under **Firewall** check **Allow HTTP traffic**.
    - Click **NETWORKING, DISKS, SECURITY, MANAGEMENT, SOLE-TENANCY**.
    - Click **Networking**, add `rdp` to the **Network tags**.
    - For **Network interfaces**, click the dropdown to edit.
    - Set the following values, leave all other values at their defaults:

        | Property | Value (type value or select option as specified) |
        | --- | --- |
        | Network | `securenetwork` |
        | Subnetwork | `secure-subnet` |
        | External IP | Ephemeral |

    - Click **Done**, then click **Add Network Interface**.
    - Set the following values, leave all other values at their defaults:

        | Property | Value (type value or select option as specified) |
        | --- | --- |
        | Network | default |
        | Subnetwork | default |
        | External IP | None |

    - Click **Done**, then click **Create**.

5. A Windows compute instance called `vm-securehost` exists that does not have a public ip-address.

    - In the **Cloud Console**, click the **Navigation menu** > **Compute Engine** > **VM Instances**.
    - Click **Create instance**.
    - Set the following values, leave all other values at their defaults:

        | Property | Value (type value or select option as specified) |
        | --- | --- |
        | Name | `vm-securehost` |
