## Challenge scenario

You are a cloud engineer intern for a new startup. For your first project, your new boss has tasked you with creating infrastructure in a quick and efficient manner and generating a mechanism to keep track of it for future reference and changes. You have been directed to use [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) to complete the project.

For this project, you will use Terraform to create, deploy, and keep track of infrastructure on the startup's preferred provider, Google Cloud. You will also need to import some mismanaged instances into your configuration and fix them.

In this lab, you will use Terraform to import and create multiple VM instances, a VPC network with two subnetworks, and a firewall rule for the VPC to allow connections between the two instances. You will also create a Cloud Storage bucket to host your remote backend.


## Task 1. Create the configuration files

1. Make the empty files and directories in Cloud Shell or the Cloud Shell Editor.

    ```
    touch main.tf
    touch variables.tf
    mkdir modules
    cd modules
    mkdir instances
    cd instances
    touch instances.tf
    touch outputs.tf
    touch variables.tf
    cd ..
    mkdir storage
    cd storage
    touch storage.tf
    touch outputs.tf
    touch variables.tf
    cd ..
    ```

2. Add the following to the each variables.tf file, and replace `PROJECT_ID` with your GCP Project ID.

    ```
    variable "region" {
        default = "us-central1"
    }

    variable "zone" {
        default = "us-central1-a"
    }

    variable "project_id" {
        default = "[PROJECT_ID]"
    }
    ```

3. Add the following to the main.tf file.

    ```
    terraform {
        required_providers {
            google = {
                source = "hashicorp/google"
                version = "3.55.0"
            }
        }
    }

    provider "google" {
        project     = var.project_id
        region      = var.region
        zone        = var.zone
    }

    module "instances" {
        source     = "./modules/instances"
    }
    ```

4. Run the following commands in Cloud Shell in the root directory to initialize terraform.

    ```
    terraform init
    ```

## Task 2. Import infrastructure

1. In the Cloud Console, go to the **Navigation menu** and select **Compute Engine**.
2. Click the `tf-instance-1`, then copy the **Instance ID** down somewhere to use later.
3. In the Cloud Console, go to the **Navigation menu** and select **Compute Engine**.
4. Click the `tf-instance-2`, then copy the **Instance ID** down somewhere to use later.
5. Next, navigate to modules/instances/instances.tf. Copy the following configuration into the file.

    ```
    resource "google_compute_instance" "tf-instance-1" {
        name         = "tf-instance-1"
        machine_type = "n1-standard-1"
        zone         = var.zone

        boot_disk {
            initialize_params {
            image = "debian-cloud/debian-10"
            }
        }

        network_interface {
            network = "default"
        }

        metadata_startup_script = <<-EOT
                #!/bin/bash
            EOT
        allow_stopping_for_update = true
    }

    resource "google_compute_instance" "tf-instance-2" {
        name         = "tf-instance-2"
        machine_type = "n1-standard-1"
        zone         = var.zone

        boot_disk {
            initialize_params {
                image = "debian-cloud/debian-10"
            }
        }

        network_interface {
            network = "default"
        }

        metadata_startup_script = <<-EOT
                #!/bin/bash
            EOT
        allow_stopping_for_update = true
    }
    ```

6. Run the following commands in Cloud Shell to import the first instance. Replace `INSTANCE_ID_1` with **Instance ID** for `tf-instance-1` you copied down earlier.

    ```
    terraform import module.instances.google_compute_instance.tf-instance-1 [INSTANCE_ID_1]
    ```

7. Run the following commands in Cloud Shell to import the first instance. Replace `INSTANCE_ID_2` with **Instance ID** for `tf-instance-2` you copied down earlier.

    ```
    terraform import module.instances.google_compute_instance.tf-instance-2 [INSTANCE_ID_2]
    ```

8. Run the following commands to apply your changes.

    ```
    terraform plan

    terraform apply
    ```

## Task 3. Configure a remote backend

1. Add the following code to the modules/storage/storage.tf file. Replace `BUCKET_NAME` with Bucket Name given in lab instructions.

    ```
    resource "google_storage_bucket" "storage-bucket" {
        name          = "[BUCKET_NAME]"
        location      = "US"
        force_destroy = true
        uniform_bucket_level_access = true
    }
    ```

2. Next, add the following to the main.tf file.

    ```
    module "storage" {
        source     = "./modules/storage"
    }
    ```

3. Run the following commands to initialize the module and create the storage bucket resource. Type yes at the dialogue after you run the apply command to accept the state changes.

    ```
    terraform init

    terraform apply
    ```

4. Next, update the main.tf file so that the terraform block looks like the following. Fill in your GCP Project ID for the bucket argument definition. Replace `BUCKET_NAME` with Bucket Name given in lab instructions.

    ```
    terraform {
        backend "gcs" {
            bucket  = "[BUCKET_NAME]"
            prefix  = "terraform/state"
        }

        required_providers {
            google = {
                source = "hashicorp/google"
                version = "3.55.0"
            }
        }
    }
    ```

5. Run the following commands to initialize the remote backend. Type yes at the prompt.

        version = "~> 3.4.0"

        project_id   = var.project_id
        network_name = "[VPC_NAME]"
        routing_mode = "GLOBAL"

        subnets = [
            {
                subnet_name           = "subnet-01"
                subnet_ip             = "10.10.10.0/24"
