## Challange scenario

You are taking over ownership of a test environment and have been given an updated version of a containerized test application to deploy. Your systems' architecture team has started adopting a containerized microservice architecture. You are responsible for managing the containerized test web applications. You will first deploy the initial version of a test application, called `echo-app` to a Kubernetes cluster called `echo-cluster` in a deployment called `echo-web`.

Before you get started, open the navigation menu and select **Cloud Storage**. The last steps in the Deployment Manager script used to set up your environment creates a bucket.

Refresh the Storage browser until you see your bucket. You can move on once your Console resembles the following:

Check to make sure your GKE cluster has been created before continuing. Open the navigation menu and select **Kuberntes Engine** > **Clusters**.

Continue when you see a green checkmark next to `echo-cluster`:

To deploy your first version of the application, run the following commands in Cloud Shell to get up and running:

```
gcloud container clusters get-credentials echo-cluster --zone=us-central1-a
```

```
kubectl create deployment echo-web --image=gcr.io/qwiklabs-resources/echo-app:v1
```

```
kubectl expose deployment echo-web --type=LoadBalancer --port 80 --target-port 8000
```


## Your challenge

You need to update the running `echo-app` application in the `echo-web` deployment from the v1 to the v2 code you have been provided. You must also scale out the application to 2 instances and confirm that they are all running.


1. Check that there is a tagged image in gcr.io for echo-app:v2.

    ```
    mkdir echo-web
    
    cd echo-web
    
    gsutil cp -r gs://$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID/echo-web-v2.tar.gz .
    
    tar -xzf echo-web-v2.tar.gz
    
    rm echo-web-v2.tar.gz
    
    docker build -t echo-app:v2 .
    
    docker tag echo-app:v2 gcr.io/$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID/echo-app:v2
    
    docker push gcr.io/$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID/echo-app:v2
    ```

2. Echo-app:v2 is running on the Kubernetes cluster.

    Deploy the first version of the application.

    ```
    gcloud container clusters get-credentials echo-cluster --zone=us-central1-a

    kubectl create deployment echo-web --image=gcr.io/qwiklabs-resources/echo-app:v1

    kubectl expose deployment echo-web --type=LoadBalancer --port 80 --target-port 8000
    ```

    Edit the `deployment.apps` file.

    ```
    kubectl edit deploy echo-web
    ```

    Start the editor by type `i`. Change `image=...:v1` to `image=...:v2`. 

    ```
    image=gcr.io/qwiklabs-resources/echo-app:v2
    ```
    
    Save the `deployment.apps` file, hit **ESC** then type `:wq` and **Enter**.

3. The Kubernetes cluster deployment reports 2 replicas.

    ```
    kubectl scale deployment echo-web --replicas=2
    ```

4. The application must respond to web requests with V2.0.0.

    ```
    kubectl expose deployment echo-web --type=LoadBalancer --port 80 --target-port 8000

    kubectl get svc
    ```
