## Challenge scenario

You have started a new role as a Junior Cloud Engineer for Jooli Inc. You're expected to help manage the Cloud infrastructure and deployment tools at Jooli. Common tasks include provisioning resources for projects and implementing new products and services to help improve Jooli's service management in real time.

You are expected to have the skills and knowledge for these tasks, so step-by-step guides won't be provided.

Some Jooli Inc. standards you should follow:

- Create all resources in the `us-east1` region and `us-east1-b` zone, unless otherwise directed.

- Use the project VPCs.

- Naming is normally *team-resource*, e.g. an instance could be named **kraken-webserver1**.

- Allocate cost effective resource sizes. Projects are monitored and excessive resource use will result in the containing project's termination (and possibly yours), so beware. This is the guidance the monitoring team is willing to share; unless directed, use `n1-standard-1`.


## Your challenge

As soon as you sit down at your desk and open your new laptop you receive the following request to complete a set of tasks. Good luck!


## Task 1: Configure a Jenkins pipeline for continuous deployment to Kubernetes Engine

![](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/E9VdW6ATD9cdUB7yQcQsqbaFXZKjw4djfO%2F6rzNCZGI%3D)

- Open a new session in **Cloud Shell** and run the following command:

    ```
    gcloud config set compute/zone us-east1-b

    git clone https://source.developers.google.com/p/$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID/r/sample-app

    gcloud container clusters get-credentials jenkins-cd

    kubectl create clusterrolebinding cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=$(gcloud config get-value account)

    helm repo add stable https://charts.helm.sh/stable

    helm repo update

    helm install cd stable/jenkins

    export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods --namespace default -l "app.kubernetes.io/component=jenkins-master" -l "app.kubernetes.io/instance=cd" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")

    kubectl port-forward $POD_NAME 8080:8080 >> /dev/null &

    printf $(kubectl get secret cd-jenkins -o jsonpath="{.data.jenkins-admin-password}" | base64 --decode);echo
    ```

- Copy the auto-generated password for Jenkins admin from output in **Cloud Shell**.
- To get to the **Jenkins** user interface, click on the **Web Preview** button in **Cloud Shell**, then click **Preview on port 8080**.
- Log in with username admin and your auto-generated password.
- Back to **Cloud Shell** and run the following command:

    ```
    cd sample-app

    kubectl create ns production

    kubectl apply -f k8s/production -n production

    kubectl apply -f k8s/canary -n production

    kubectl apply -f k8s/services -n production

    kubectl get svc

    kubectl get service gceme-frontend -n production

    git init

    git config credential.helper gcloud.sh

    git remote add origin https://source.developers.google.com/p/$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID/r/sample-app

    git config --global user.email "[YOUR-EMAIL]"

    git config --global user.name "[YOUR-USERNAME]"

    git add .

    git commit -m "initial commit"

    git push origin master
    ```

- Adding your service account credentials.

    - In the Jenkins user interface, click **Manage Jenkins** in the left navigation then click **Manage Credentials**.
    - Under **Stores scope to Jenkins** click **Jenkins**.
    - Click **Global credentials (unrestricted)**.
    - Click **Add Credentials** in the left navigation.
    - Select **Google Service Account from metadata** from the **Kind** drop-down and click **OK**.

- Creating the Jenkins job.

    - Click **New Item** in the left navigation.
    - Name the project **sample-app**, then choose the **Multibranch Pipeline** option and click **OK**.
    - On the next page, in the **Branch Sources** section, click **Add Source** and select **git**.
    - Paste the **HTTPS clone URL** of your sample-app repo in Cloud Source Repositories into the **Project Repository** field. Replace `[PROJECT_ID]` with your **Project ID**:

        ```
        https://source.developers.google.com/p/[PROJECT_ID]/r/default
        ```

    - From the **Credentials** drop-down, select the name of the credentials you created when adding your service account in the previous steps.
    - Under **Scan Multibranch Pipeline Triggers** section, check the **Periodically if not otherwise run** box and set the **Interval** value to 1 minute.
    - Click **Save** leaving all other options with their defaults.


## Task 2: Push an update to the application to a development branch

![](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/C3OfZh5xEFhWYvqSwFqu9kZ2mQsYSaDKWLsK7qfx7Ws%3D)

- Back to **Cloud Shell** and create a development branch and push it to the Git server.

    ```
    git checkout -b new-feature
    ```

- Open the file `main.go` in the root folder of the repo.

    ```
    vi main.go
    ```

    Start the editor by type `i`. Change the version number to `Version`. 

    ```Go
    const version string = "Version"
    ```

    Save the `main.go` file, hit **ESC** then type `:wq` and **Enter**.

- Modify the site, open the file `html.go`.

    ```
    vi html.go
    ```

    Start the editor by type `i`. Change both lines that contains the word `blue` to `Colour`. 

    ```Go
    <div class="card Colour">
    ```

    Save the `html.go` file, hit **ESC** then type `:wq` and **Enter**.

- Commit and push your changes.

    ```
    git add Jenkinsfile html.go main.go

    git commit -m "Version [VERSION-NUMBER]"

    git push origin new-feature
    ```

    After the change is pushed to the Git repository, navigate to the Jenkins user interface where you can see that your build started for the `new-feature` branch.

- Start the proxy in the background.

    ```
    kubectl proxy &
    ```

- If it stalls, press **Ctrl + C** to exit out. Verify that your application is accessible by sending a request to `localhost` and letting `kubectl` proxy forward it to your service.

    ```
    curl http://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/new-feature/services/gceme-frontend:80/proxy/version
    ```

    You should see it respond with `Version`, which is the version that is now running.

## Task 3: Push a Canary deployment to the production namespace

- Create a new branch called canary, merge the development branch with it, and push that to the repository.

    ```
    git checkout -b canary

    git merge new-feature

    git push origin canary
    ```

- Once complete, you can check the service URL to ensure that some of the traffic is being served by your new version.

    ```
    export FRONTEND_SERVICE_IP=$(kubectl get -o \
    jsonpath="{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}" --namespace=production services gceme-frontend)

    while true; do curl http://$FRONTEND_SERVICE_IP/version; sleep 1; done
    ```

    If you keep seeing 1.0.0, try running the above commands again. Once you've verified that the above works, end the command with **Ctrl + C**.


## Task 4: Promote the Canary Deployment to production

- Merge the Canary branch with master in order to trigger a Jenkins build for the updated master branch.

    ```
    git checkout master

    git merge canary

    git push origin master
    ```

- Once complete, you can check the service URL to ensure that some of the traffic is being served by your new version.

    ```
    export FRONTEND_SERVICE_IP=$(kubectl get -o \
    jsonpath="{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}" --namespace=production services gceme-frontend)

    while true; do curl http://$FRONTEND_SERVICE_IP/version; sleep 1; done
    ```

    If you keep seeing 1.0.0, try running the above commands again. Once you've verified that the above works, end the command with **Ctrl + C**.

- Retrieve the external IP for the production services

    ```
    kubectl get service gceme-frontend -n production
    ```


## Congratulations!
