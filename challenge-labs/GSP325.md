## Challenge scenario

As a junior developer in Jooli Inc. and recently trained with Google Cloud and Dialogflow you have been asked to help a new team (Taniwha) set up their environment. The team has asked for your help and has done some work, but needs you to complete the work.

You are expected to have the skills and knowledge for these tasks so don’t expect step-by-step guides.


## Your challenge

You need to help the team with some of their initial work creating two new Dialogflow apps.

As soon as you sit down at your desk and open your new laptop you receive the following request to complete these tasks. Good luck!


## Task 1: Create the Cloud Function for the Magic Eight Ball app for Google Assistant

1. In the **Cloud Console**, click the **Navigation menu** > **Cloud Functions**.
2. Click **Create function**.
3. In the **Create function** dialog, enter the following values:

    - Function Name: `CLOUD_FUNCTION_NAME`
    - Authentication: Allow unauthenticated invocations
    - Maximum Number of Instances: 5
    - Runtime: Python 3.9
    - Entry Point (Function to execute): `ENTRY_POINT`
    - Source Code: Inline editor
    - Replace code for main.py and requirements.txt

        In line 6 of main.py replace the text **REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_ENTRY_POINT** with `ENTRY_POINT`.

        main.py:

        ```Python
        import random
        import logging
        import google.cloud.logging
        from google.cloud import translate_v2 as translate
        from flask import Flask, request, make_response, jsonify
        def REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_ENTRY_POINT(request):
            client = google.cloud.logging.Client()
            client.get_default_handler()
            client.setup_logging()
            choices = [
                "It is certain.", "It is decidedly so.", "Without a doubt.", "Yes - definitely.", "You may rely on it.", "As I see it, yes.", "Most likely.", "Outlook good.", "Yes.","Signs point to yes.", "Reply hazy, try again.", "Ask again later.", "Better not tell you now.", "Cannot predict now.", "Concentrate and ask again.", "Don't count on it.", "My reply is no.", "My sources say no.", "Outlook not so good.", "Very doubtful."
            ]
            magic_eight_ball_response = random.choice(choices)
            logging.info(magic_eight_ball_response)
            return make_response(jsonify({'fulfillmentText': magic_eight_ball_response }))
        ```

        requirements.txt:

        ```Txt
        google-cloud-translate
        google-cloud-logging
        ```

    - Click **Deploy**.

4. In the Cloud Functions page, click on the three dots next to your cloud function name under **Action** column, then click **Test**.
5. Copy and paste the following event JSON object to **Triggering event** in the **Testing** tab:

    ```JSON
    {
        "responseId": "5f996cad-5dfc-40f2-a43d-b6b20e8b24d2-a14fa99c",
        "queryResult": {
            "queryText": "Will I complete this challenge？",
            "action": "input.unknown",
            "parameters": {},
            "allRequiredParamsPresent": true,
            "outputContexts": [
                {
                    "name": "projects/qwiklabs-gcp-02-b32433699489/agent/sessions/3767e11a-acf0-30f7-5a36-2e8e720f26cd/contexts/__system_counters__",
                    "lifespanCount": 1,
                    "parameters": {
                        "no-input": 0,
                        "no-match": 3
                    }
                }
            ],
            "intent": {
                "name": "projects/qwiklabs-gcp-02-b32433699489/agent/intents/80346ab5-5af8-4f52-bc0c-784529bf6990",
                "displayName": "Default Fallback Intent",
                "isFallback": true,
                "endInteraction": true
            },
            "intentDetectionConfidence": 1,
            "languageCode": "en"
        },
        "originalDetectIntentRequest": {
            "payload": {}
        },
        "session": "projects/qwiklabs-gcp-02-b32433699489/agent/sessions/3767e11a-acf0-30f7-5a36-2e8e720f26cd"
    }
    ```

6. Click **Test the function** to testing your Cloud Function.

        - **App**: Alright. Here's the test version of magic 8 ball. Welcome to the lab magic 8 ball, ask me a yes or no question and I will predict the future!
        - **User**: Will I complete this challenge lab?
        - **App**: Concentrate and ask again.


## Task 3: Add multilingual support to your Cloud Function

1. Back to Function details in the Google Cloud Platform console, then click **Edit**.
2. In main.py after line `magic_eight_ball_response = random.choice(choices)`, add the following code:

    ```Python
        request_json = request.get_json()
        if request_json and 'queryResult' in request_json:
            question = request_json.get('queryResult').get('queryText')
        # try to identify the language
        language = 'en'
        translate_client = translate.Client()
        detected_language = translate_client.detect_language(question)
        if detected_language['language'] == 'und':
            language = 'en'
        elif detected_language['language'] != 'en':
            language = detected_language['language']
        # translate if not english
        if language != 'en':
            logging.info('translating from en to %s' % language)
            translated_text = translate_client.translate(
                magic_eight_ball_response, target_language=language)
            magic_eight_ball_response = translated_text['translatedText']
    ```

3. Click **Deploy**.
4. Back to Test page, then test the app using the following sentences in non-English languages:

    - 我会完成这个挑战实验室吗？
    - ¿Completaré este laboratorio de desafío?
    - இந்த சவால் ஆய்வகத்தை நான் முடிக்கலாமா?
