## Challenge scenario

You have started a new role as a junior member of the security team for the Orca team in Jooli Inc. Your team is responsible for ensuring the security of the Cloud infrastucture and services that the company's applications depend on.

You are expected to have the skills and knowledge for these tasks, so don't expect step-by-step guides to be provided.


## Your challenge

You have been asked to deploy, configure, and test a new Kubernetes Engine cluster that will be used for application development and pipeline testing by the the Orca development team.

As per the organisation's security standards you must ensure that the new Kubernetes Engine cluster is built according to the organisation's most recent security standards and thereby must comply with the following:

- The cluster must be deployed using a dedicated service account configured with the least privileges required.
- The cluster must be deployed as a Kubernetes Engine private cluster, with the public endpoint disabled, and the master authorized network set to include only the ip-address of the Orca group's management jumphost.
- The Kubernetes Engine private cluster must be deployed to the orca-build-subnet in the Orca Build VPC.

From a previous project you know that the minimum permissions required by the service account that is specified for a Kubernetes Engine cluster is covered by these three built in roles:

- roles/monitoring.viewer
- roles/monitoring.metricWriter
- roles/logging.logWriter

These roles are sepcified in the [documentation for hardening cluster security](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/hardening-your-cluster#use_least_privilege_sa).

You must bind the above roles to the service account used by the cluster as well as a custom role that you must create in order to provide access to any other services specified by the development team. Initially you have been told that the development team requires that the service account used by the cluster should have the permissions necessary to add and update objects in Google Cloud Storage buckets. To do this you will have to create a new custom IAM role that will provide the following permissions:

- storage.buckets.get
- storage.objects.get
- storage.objects.list
- storage.objects.update
- storage.objects.create

Once you have created the new private cluster you must test that it is correctly configured by connecting to it from the jumphost, `orca-jumphost`, in the management subnet `orca-mgmt-subnet`. As this compute instance is not in the same subnet as the private cluster you must make sure that the master authorized networks for the cluster includes the internal ip-address for the instance, and you must specify the `--internal-ip` flag when retrieving cluster credentials using the `gcloud container clusters get-credentials` command.

All new cloud objects and services that you create should include the "orca-" prefix.

Your final task is to validate that the cluster is working correctly by deploying a simple application to the cluster to test that management access to the cluster using the `kubectl` tool is working from the `orca-jumphost` compute instance.


## Task 1: Create a custom security role.

Set the default zone to `us-east1-b` and create `role-definition.yaml` file.

```
gcloud config set compute/zone us-east1-b

nano role-definition.yaml
```

Add the configuration below.

```
title: "[TITLE]"
description: "[DESCRIPTION]"
includedPermissions:
- storage.buckets.get
- storage.objects.get
- storage.objects.list
- storage.objects.update
- storage.objects.create
```

Press **Ctrl + O** and then press **Enter** to save your edited file. Press **Ctrl + X** to exit the nano editor. Create a custom security role.

```
gcloud iam roles create [CUSTOM_SECURITY_ROLE] \
    --project $DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID \
    --file role-definition.yaml
```


## Task 2: Create a service account.

```
gcloud iam service-accounts create [SERVICE_ACCOUNT] \
    --display-name "[DISPLAY_NAME]"
```


## Task 3: Bind a custom security role to a service account.

```
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID \
    --member serviceAccount:[SERVICE_ACCOUNT]@$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
    --role roles/monitoring.viewer

gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID \
    --member serviceAccount:[SERVICE_ACCOUNT]@$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
    --role roles/monitoring.metricWriter

gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID \
    --member serviceAccount:[SERVICE_ACCOUNT]@$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
    --role roles/logging.logWriter

gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID \
    --member serviceAccount:[SERVICE_ACCOUNT]@$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
    --role projects/$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID/roles/[CUSTOM_SECURITY_ROLE]
```


## Task 4: Create and configure a new Kubernetes Engine private cluster

```
gcloud container clusters create [CLUSTER_NAME] \
    --network orca-build-vpc \
    --subnetwork orca-build-subnet \
    --service-account [SERVICE_ACCOUNT]@$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
    --enable-master-authorized-networks \
    --master-authorized-networks [INTERNAL_IP]/32 \
    --enable-ip-alias \
    --enable-private-nodes \
    --master-ipv4-cidr [IP_ADDRESS_RANGES]/28 \
    --enable-private-endpoint
```


## Task 5: Deploy an application to a private Kubernetes Engine cluster

In the **Cloud Console**, click the **Navigation menu** > **Compute Engine** > **VM Instances**. Click on the SSH button next to `orca-jumphost` instance. Get the Kubernetes credentials.

```
gcloud container clusters get-credentials [CLUSTER_NAME] \
    --internal-ip \
    --zone us-east1-b
```

Create and expose a deployment in Kubernetes.

```
kubectl create deployment hello-server --image=gcr.io/google-samples/hello-app:1.0

kubectl expose deployment hello-server --type=LoadBalancer --port 80 --target-port 8080
```


## Congratulations!
