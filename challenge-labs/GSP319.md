## Challenge lab scenario

You have just started a new role at FancyStore, Inc.

Your task is to take the company's existing monolithic e-commerce website and break it into a series of logically separated microservices. The existing monolith code is sitting in a GitHub repo, and you will be expected to containerize this app and then refactor it.

You are expected to have the skills and knowledge for these tasks, so don't expect step-by-step guides.

You have been asked to take the lead on this, after the last team suffered from monolith-related burnout and left for greener pastures (literally, they are running a lavender farm now). You will be tasked with pulling down the source code, building a container from it (one of the farmers left you a Dockerfile), and then pushing it out to GKE.

You should first build, deploy, and test the Monolith, just to make sure that the source code is sound. After that, you should break out the constituent services into their own microservice deployments.

Some FancyStore, Inc. standards you should follow:

- Create your cluster in `us-central1`.
- Naming is normally team-resource, e.g. an instance could be named **fancystore-orderservice1**.
- Allocate cost effective resource sizes. Projects are monitored and excessive resource use will result in the containing project's termination.
- Use the `n1-standard-1` machine type unless directed otherwise.


## Your challenge

As soon as you sit down at your desk and open your new laptop, you receive the following request to complete these tasks. Good luck!


## Task 1: Download the monolith code and build your container

First things first, you'll need to [clone your team's git repo](https://github.com/googlecodelabs/monolith-to-microservices.git). 

```
git clone https://github.com/googlecodelabs/monolith-to-microservices.git
```

There's a `setup.sh` script in the root directory of the project that you'll need to run to get your monolith container built up.

```
cd ~/monolith-to-microservices

./setup.sh
```

After running the setup.sh script, ensure your Cloud Shell is running its latest version of nodeJS.

```
nvm install --lts
```

There's a Dockerfile located in the `~/monotlith-to-microservices/monolith` folder which you can use to build the application container. Before building the Docker container, you can preview the monolith application on **port 8080**.

```
cd ~/monolith-to-microservices/monolith

npm start
```

You will have to run Cloud Build (in that monolith folder) to build it, then push it up to GCR. Name your artifact as follows:

- GCR Repo: gcr.io/${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}
- Image name: `MONOLITH IDENTIFIER`
- Image version: 1.0.0

```
gcloud services enable cloudbuild.googleapis.com

gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}/[MONOLITH_IDENTIFIER]:1.0.0 .
```


## Task 2: Create a kubernetes cluster and deploy the application

Create your cluster as follows:

- Cluster name: `CLUSTER_NAME`
- Region: us-central1-a
- Node count: 3

```
gcloud config set compute/zone us-central1-a

gcloud services enable container.googleapis.com

gcloud container clusters create [CLUSTER_NAME] --num-nodes 3
```

Create and expose your deployment as follows:

- Cluster name: `CLUSTER_NAME`
- Container name: `MONOLITH_IDENTIFIER`
- Container version: 1.0.0
- Application port: 8080
- Externally accessible port: 80

```
kubectl create deployment [MONOLITH_IDENTIFIER] --image=gcr.io/${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}/[MONOLITH_IDENTIFIER]:1.0.0

kubectl expose deployment [MONOLITH_IDENTIFIER] --type=LoadBalancer --port 80 --target-port 8080
```


## Task 3: Create a containerized version of your Microservices

Below is the set of services which need to be containerized. Navigate to the source roots mentioned below, and upload the artifacts which are created to the Google Container Registry with the metadata indicated. Name your artifact as follows:

**Orders Microservice**

- Service root folder: `~/monolith-to-microservices/microservices/src/orders`
- GCR Repo: gcr.io/${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}
- Image name: `ORDERS_IDENTIFIER`
- Image version: 1.0.0

```
cd ~/monolith-to-microservices/microservices/src/orders

gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}/[ORDERS_IDENTIFIER]:1.0.0 .
```

**Products Microservice**

- Service root folder: `~/monolith-to-microservices/microservices/src/products`
- GCR Repo: gcr.io/${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}
- Image name: `PRODUCTS_IDENTIFIER`
- Image version: 1.0.0

```
cd ~/monolith-to-microservices/microservices/src/products

gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}/[PRODUCTS_IDENTIFIER]:1.0.0 .
```


## Task 4: Deploy the new microservices

Deploy these new containers following the same process that you followed for the `Monolith Identifier` monolith. Note that these services will be listening on different ports, so make note of the port mappings in the table below. Create and expose your deployments as follows:

**Orders Microservice**

- Cluster name: `CLUSTER_NAME`
- Container name: `ORDERS_IDENTIFIER`
- Container version: 1.0.0
- Application port: 8081
- Externally accessible port: 80

```
kubectl create deployment [ORDERS_IDENTIFIER] --image=gcr.io/${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}/[ORDERS_IDENTIFIER]:1.0.0

kubectl expose deployment [ORDERS_IDENTIFIER] --type=LoadBalancer --port 80 --target-port 8081
```

**Products Microservice**

- Cluster name: `CLUSTER_NAME`
- Container name: `PRODUCTS_IDENTIFIER`
- Container version: 1.0.0
- Application port: 8082
- Externally accessible port: 80

```
kubectl create deployment [PRODUCTS_IDENTIFIER] --image=gcr.io/${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}/[PRODUCTS_IDENTIFIER]:1.0.0

kubectl expose deployment [PRODUCTS_IDENTIFIER] --type=LoadBalancer --port 80 --target-port 8082
```


## Task 5: Configure the Frontend microservice

Use the `nano` editor to replace the local URL with the IP address of the new Products microservices.

```
cd ~/monolith-to-microservices/react-app
nano .env
```

When the editor opens, your file should look like this.

```
REACT_APP_ORDERS_URL=http://localhost:8081/api/orders
REACT_APP_PRODUCTS_URL=http://localhost:8082/api/products
```

Replace the `REACT_APP_ORDERS_URL` and `REACT_APP_PRODUCTS_URL` to the new format while replacing with your Orders and Product microservice IP addresses so it matches below.

```
REACT_APP_ORDERS_URL=http://<ORDERS_IP_ADDRESS>/api/orders
REACT_APP_PRODUCTS_URL=http://<PRODUCTS_IP_ADDRESS>/api/products
```

Press **CTRL+O**, press **ENTER**, then **CTRL+X** to save the file in the `nano` editor. Now rebuild the frontend app before containerizing it.

```
npm run build
```


## Task 6: Create a containerized version of the Frontend microservice

The final step is to containerize and deploy the Frontend. Use Cloud Build to package up the contents of the Frontend service and push it up to the Google Container Registry.

- Service root folder: `~/monolith-to-microservices/microservices/src/frontend`
- GCR Repo: gcr.io/${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}
- Image name: `FRONTEND_IDENTIFIER`
- Image version: 1.0.0

```
cd ~/monolith-to-microservices/microservices/src/frontend

gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}/[FRONTEND_IDENTIFIER]:1.0.0 .
```


## Task 7: Deploy the Frontend microservice

Deploy this container following the same process that you followed for the **Orders** and **Products** microservices. Create and expose your deployment as follows:

- Cluster name: `CLUSTER_NAME`
- Container name: `FRONTEND_IDENTIFIER`
- Container version: 1.0.0
- Application port: 8080
- Externally accessible port: 80

```
kubectl create deployment [FRONTEND_IDENTIFIER] --image=gcr.io/${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}/[FRONTEND_IDENTIFIER]:1.0.0

kubectl expose deployment [FRONTEND_IDENTIFIER] --type=LoadBalancer --port 80 --target-port 8080
```
