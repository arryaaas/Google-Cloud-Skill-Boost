## Challange scenario

Your WordPress blog is running on a server that is no longer suitable. As the first part of a complete migration exercise, you are migrating the locally hosted database used by the blog to Cloud SQL.

The existing WordPress installation is installed in the `/var/www/html/wordpress` directory in the instance called `blog` that is already running in the lab. You can access the blog by opening a web browser and pointing to the external IP address of the blog instance.

The existing database for the blog is provided by MySQL running on the same server. The existing MySQL database is called `wordpress` and the user called **blogadmin** with password __Password1*__, which provides full access to that database.


## Your challenge

You need to create a new Cloud SQL instance to host the migrated database. Once you have created the new database and configured it, you can then create a database dump of the existing database and import it into Cloud SQL. When the data has been migrated, you will then reconfigure the blog software to use the migrated database.

For this lab, the WordPress site configuration file is located here: `/var/www/html/wordpress/wp-config.php.`

To sum it all up, your challenge is to migrate the database to Cloud SQL and then reconfigure the application so that it no longer relies on the local MySQL database. Good luck!


1. Check that there is a Cloud SQL instance.

    - In the **Cloud Console**, click the **Navigation menu** > **SQL**.
    - Click **Create instance**.
    - Select `MySQL` as a **Database Engine**.
    - Set the following values, leave all other values at their defaults:

        | Property | Value (type value or select option as specified) |
        | --- | --- |
        | Instance ID | `INSTANCE_NAME` |
        | Password | Enter a secure password and remember it |

    - Click **Create instance**.

2. Check that there is a user database on the Cloud SQL instance.

    - In the **Cloud Console**, click the **Navigation menu** > **Compute Engine** > **VM Instances**.
    - Click on the SSH button next to `blog` instance.
    - Run the following command:

        ```
        mysqldump --databases wordpress -h localhost -u blogadmin -p \
            --hex-blob \
            --skip-triggers \
            --single-transaction \
            --default-character-set=utf8mb4 > wordpress.sql
        
        export PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud info --format='value(config.project)')

        gsutil mb gs://${PROJECT_ID}

        gsutil cp ~/wordpress.sql gs://${PROJECT_ID}
        ```

    - Exit the SSH.
    - In the **Cloud Console**, click the **Navigation menu** > **SQL**.
    - Click the **MySQL Instance** you created in the previous step.
    - Select **Databases** tab then click **Create Database**.
    - Set the following values, leave all other values at their defaults:

        | Property | Value (type value or select option as specified) |
        | --- | --- |
        | Database Name | wordpress |
        | Character Set | utf8mb4 |
    
    - Click **Create**.
    - Select **Overview** tab then click **Import**.
    - Set the following values, leave all other values at their defaults:

        | Property | Value (type value or select option as specified) |
        | --- | --- |
        | Cloud Storage file | [CLOUD_STORAGE_BUCKET]/wordpress.sql |
        | Format of import | SQL |
        | Databases | wordpress |

    - Click **Import**.

3. Check that the blog instance is authorized to access Cloud SQL.

    - Select **Users** tab then click **Add User Account**.
    - Set the following values, leave all other values at their defaults:

        | Property | Value (type value or select option as specified) |
        | --- | --- |
        | Username | blogadmin |
        | Password | __Password1*__ |

    - Select **Connections** tab.
    - Under **Authorized networks** click **Add Network**.
    - Set the following values, leave all other values at their defaults:

        | Property | Value (type value or select option as specified) |
        | --- | --- |
        | Name | blog |
        | Network | **External IP** of the `blog` instance |

        Change the latest part of the IP address with 0 and add /24 ( example: If IP = 35.193.246.21, fill with 35.193.246.0/24 )

    - Click **Done**.
    - Click **Save**.

4. Check that wp-config.php points to the Cloud SQL instance.

    - Select **Overview** tab.
    - In **Connect to this instance** section, copy **Public IP address**.
    - In the **Cloud Console**, click the **Navigation menu** > **Compute Engine** > **VM Instances**.
    - Click on the SSH button next to `blog` instance.
    - Run the following command:

        ```
        cd /var/www/html/wordpress/
        
        sudo nano wp-config.php
        ```

    - Replace `localhost` string on `DB_HOST` with **Public IP address** of SQL Instance that has copied before.
    - Press **Ctrl + O** and then press **Enter** to save your edited file. Press **Ctrl + X** to exit the nano editor.
    - Exit the SSH.

5. Check that the blog still responds to requests.

    - In the **Cloud Console**, click the **Navigation menu** > **Compute Engine** > **VM Instances**.
    - Click the **External IP** of the `blog` instance.
    - Verify that no error.


## Congratulations!
