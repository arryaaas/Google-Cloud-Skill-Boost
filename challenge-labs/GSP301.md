## Challenge scenario

You have been given the responsibility of managing the configuration of your organization's Google Cloud virtual machines. You have decided to make some changes to the framework used for managing the deployment and configuration machines - you want to make it easier to modify the startup scripts used to initialize a number of the compute instances. Instead of storing startup scripts directly in the instances' metadata, you have decided to store the scripts in a Cloud Storage bucket and then configure the virtual machines to point to the relevant script file in the bucket.

A basic bash script that installs the Apache web server software called `install-web.sh` has been provided for you as a sample startup script. You can download this from the Student Resources links on the left side of the page.


## Your challenge

Configure a Linux Compute Engine instance that installs the Apache web server software using a remote startup script. In order to confirm that a compute instance Apache has successfully installed, the Compute Engine instance must be accessible via HTTP from the internet.


1. Confirm that a Google Cloud Storage bucket exists that contains a file.

    - In the **Cloud Console**, click the **Navigation menu** > **Cloud Storage** > **Browser**.
    - Click **Create Bucket**. 
    - Create a bucket with a unique bucket name.
    - Click **Create**.
    - In the **Bucket details** page, click **Upload file**.
    - Upload `install-web.sh` file to the bucket.
    - In the **Bucket details** page, click the **Permissions** tab.
    - In the **Access control** section, click **Switch to Fine-grained**.
    - Select **Fine-grained**, then click **Save**.
    - In the **Bucket details** page, click the **Objects** tab.
    - Click on the three dots next to `install-web.sh` file, then click **Edit access**.
    - Set the following values, leave all other values at their defaults:

        | Property | Value (type value or select option as specified) |
        | --- | --- |
        | Entity 1 | Public |
        | Name 1 | allUsers |
        | Access 1 | Reader |

    - Click **Save**.

2. Confirm that a compute instance has been created that has a remote startup script called `install-web.sh` configured.

    - In the **Cloud Console**, click the **Navigation menu** > **Compute Engine** > **VM Instances**.
    - Click **Create instance**.
    - In the **Create an instance** page, leave all other values at their defaults.
    - Click **Networking**, **Disk**, **Security**, **Management**, **Sole-Tenancy**.
    - Click the **Management** tab.
    - Under **Metadata** section, click **Add item**.
    - Set the following values, leave all other values at their defaults:

        | Property | Value (type value or select option as specified) |
        | --- | --- |
        | Key 1 | startup-script-url |
        | Value 1 | `gs://[YOUR_BUCKET_NAME]/install-web.sh` |

    - Dont click **Create** first, go to step 3.

3. Confirm that a HTTP access firewall rule exists with tag that applies to that virtual machine.

    - Still on **Create an instance** page.
    - Under **Firewall** check **Allow HTTP traffic**.
    - Click **Create**.

4. Connect to the server ip-address using HTTP and get a non-error response.

    - In the **Cloud Console**, click the **Navigation menu** > **Compute Engine** > **VM Instances**.
    - Click the **External IP** of the **VM Instance** you created in the previous step.
    - You should view the **Apache default** page.


## Congratulations!
